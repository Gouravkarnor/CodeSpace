# CodingPracticePlatform (CodeSpace)  

A coding practice platform that allows users to solve coding problems, test their code, and view their submission history. The platform also provides an admin interface for managing problems.

## Tech Stack

- **MongoDB** - For storing user data, problems, and submission history.
- **Express.js** - Backend framework for handling API requests and routing.
- **React.js** - Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- **Node.js** - Backend runtime for executing JavaScript code on the server.

## Features

1. **Admin Problem Management**  
   Admins can create and manage coding problems, including defining problem statements, test cases, and expected outputs. This allows admins to maintain a dynamic library of coding challenges for users to solve.

2. **User Authentication and Problem Solving**  
   Users can register, log in, and view a list of available problems. They can submit solutions to these problems, which are then evaluated based on predefined test cases. The platform supports real-time feedback on code submissions.

3. **Code Playground**  
   Users have access to an interactive environment where they can write, run, and test their code directly within the platform. This feature enables users to solve problems in a seamless coding interface without needing external tools.

4. **Submission History**  
   Users can view a detailed history of their previous submissions. This includes information on the submission status (e.g., pass, fail) and results based on the test cases defined by the admin.
